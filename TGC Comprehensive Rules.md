<h1> Comprehensive TGC Rules </h1>

<h2> 0: About this Document </h2> <br>

0.1: This is the TGC Comprehensive Rules, explaining how to play the TGC. <br>
0.2: Card text takes priority over the rules, and specific interactions mentioned in this repository take priority over the general rules.<br>
0.3: Sections marked as ".x:" are clarifications; they are not necessary rules text but examples, reminders and etc to make learning the game easier. <br>
    0.3.1: Sections ".x:" also fall under rule 0.2 in that if there were to be deviations or contradictions between the ".x:" sections and the main sections of this document then the non-".x:" sections take precedence over the ".x:" ones. <br>

<h2> 1: Card & Game Basics </h2> 

1.1: To start a game you need two players. <br>

1.2: Each player needs a deck of cards to play. <br>
    1.2.1: Decks must include 40 total cards.  <br>
    1.2.2: You can run up to 4 copies of a specific card in your deck. <br>
    1.2.3: All cards in your deck must be a legal TGC card. <br>
    1.2.4: The following rules are deckbuilding rules for the tournament standard of TGC and may be ignored freely in casual play. <br>
        1.2.4.1: When building your deck choose 3 card subtypes. Every card in your deck must have at least one of these subtypes. <br>
        1.2.4.2: Every card in your deck must be legal, not banned and not be misprint. <br>

1.3: A coin toss is done to decide who goes first. <br>
    1.3.1: The coin toss decides who goes first, not who decides to go first. <br>
    1.3.x: This means a player is decided to be heads and the other tails; whichever side the coin lands on goes first. <br>

1.4: Each player draws 5 cards from their deck. <br>
1.5: Then, each player may mulligan cards in their hand. <br>
    1.5.1 During the mulligan each player may discard a card (face-down) from their hand to draw 1. This may be done upto three times, and you do not need to draw all three at once.<br>
        1.5.1.x: The opponent is not allowed to see the discarded cards but can know how many cards you chose to discard.  <br>
    1.5.3: After both players have finished mulliganing shuffle all discarded cards back into the deck. <br>

1.6: Both players starts with 20 Heathshards (or HS) and 1 Plasma. <br>
1.7: The game begins on the Draw Phase of the player who won the coin toss. <br>
1.8: The player that plays second keeps the coin and places it besides them, flipped on heads. <br>
     1.9.x: This is relevant for the \"Flip Coin\" action, detailed in 3.6 <br>

1.9: Turns in this game are divided in 5 parts, called the phases. <br>
    1.9.a: Draw Phase <br>
    1.9.b: Standby Phase <br>
    1.9.c: Play Phase <br>
    1.9.d: Battle Phase <br>
    1.9.e: End Phase <br>
        1.9.x: There is no \"Play Phase 2\". You do not get to return to a Play Phase after the Battle Phase. <br>

1.10: During the Draw Phase a number of automatic game actions happen, in the following order. <br>
    1.10.1: The turn player\'s plasma gets set to the amount of Draw Phases they have had in total, including this one. <br>
        1.10.1.x: So on their first turn they get 1 plasma, on their second 2 plasma, on their third 3 plasma, etc. <br>
    1.10.2: The turn player draws a card. <br>
    1.10.3: The turn player untaps all their tapped cards. <br>
    1.10.4: The "Pass Phase" action is immediately performed. <br>
    1.10.5: This Pass Phase does not create an Open gamestate. <br>

1.11: Terminology definitions: <br>
    1.11.a: When you draw a card you add the top card of your deck to your hand. <br>
    1.11.b: When a card is destroyed it is moved to the discard pile <br>
        1.11.b.1: When a card is destroyed all cards attached to it also get destroyed. <br>
    1.11.c: When a card is tapped it is flipped sideways. <br>
    1.11.d: When a card is untapped it is returned to the upright position <br>

1.12: Any player that have their HP reduced to, set to or at 0 loses the game automatically. <br>
1.12.1: When this happens the other player immediately wins the game. <br>
    1.12.x: This can happen even if the game is in a Closed Gamestate <br>

<h2> Open and Closed States </h2>  <br>

2: The gamestate can either be Open or Closed. <br>

2.3: There are three types of Open gamestates: Open Play Gamestate, Open Battle Gamestate and the Open Quick Gamestate <br>
    2.3.x: These can be refered to as Open Play, Open Battle and Open Quick. <br>

2.5: Different phases have diferente gamestates they default to. <br>
    2.5.1: The only exception is the Draw Phase which does not have any Open gamestates and **always** is Closed. No Open Quick gamestate may happen here. <br>
    2.5.2: When the gamestate "defaults" it means the gamestate is changed from its current gamestate to a new gamestate. Which new gamestate gets made depends on the current phase. <br>
        2.5.2.x: This is called "defaulting", "the gamestate defaulting" or similar variations. <br>
    2.3.3: Once a gamestate defaults the player that can play in that gamestate is the turn player. <br>
